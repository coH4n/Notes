## VIRTUALIZATION

Today, I will try to explain what you need to know about virtualization in the simplest way possible.

**What is Virtualization:** 

To put it simply, it is the distribution of the functional power of a physical machine's hardware components across multiple virtual machines. I would also like to note here that you may hear the terms Cloud and Virtualization being used interchangeably, but they are absolutely not the same. Virtualization is a component of the Cloud, while the Cloud is a much larger structure than Virtualization.

The structure that makes it possible to virtualize the hardware components on this physical machine is called a hypervisor.

**What is Hypervisor:**

We can say it's a software that runs on a physical server or host computer, or a very lightweight operating system. To elaborate on this definition, the hypervisor running on the server side is referred to as a very simple operating system, whereas the hypervisor that runs on a normal user's side can be referred to as a software. I also adopt this definition because the hypervisor is divided into two categories. If we look at these through the diagram below:
