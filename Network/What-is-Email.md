In this article, I will try to explain email, which has been a part of our lives since the very beginning of the internet. I believe it's important to understand how this system, which we use so frequently today, works, even in its simplest form.

**What is Email:**
We can define email as a communication method used to convey information over the internet. To make this definition a bit clearer, let's use a real-world example. In the old days, when a person wanted to send a letter, it was delivered by a mailman and placed in the recipient's mailbox. The recipient would then access the letter when they checked their mailbox. The email communication method is essentially an adaptation of that old system for the digital world. Here, the servers act as our digital mailmen. To get started, let's define what these servers are.

**IMAP and POP:** The protocol used to receive emails from the other party.

**SMTP:** The protocol used to send an email to the other party.

**What is POP3? (I would like to inform you that I copied the definition here from the internet, because it was explained exactly as I wanted):**

It is a protocol used by local email clients such as Outlook, Thunderbird, Windows Mail, and Mac Mail to communicate with a remote email server and download emails. These email clients usually have an option to keep or not keep a copy of the downloaded emails on the server. If you are connecting to the same email account from multiple devices, it is recommended that you keep a copy of the emails on the server. Otherwise, after one device downloads the email, it will delete that email from the remote server, and the other devices will not be able to access it.

**What are the advantages and disadvantages of the POP3 protocol?**

**advantages:**

-Since the email is downloaded to your device, you can view it even if you don't have an internet connection.

-It saves storage space on the mail server because emails are deleted after being downloaded to a device, provided that the configuration is set this way.
