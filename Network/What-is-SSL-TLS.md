## HTTPS HANDSHAKE ## 

Hello everyone, in this article, I will try to introduce one of the questions that might be asked in interviews: the HTTPS handshake, also known as the SSL/TLS handshake. Even if it's not an interview question, I can say that it's one of the essential topics to know if you work in or are interested in the field of cybersecurity. I should remind you that the handshake process I'm describing is for SSL/TLS up to version 1.2. In the latest version, SSL/TLS 1.3, the handshake structure and the asymmetric encryption used are different, which I will cover in another article. Additionally, to better understand the SSL/TLS handshake process, you need to know the working principles of both asymmetric and symmetric encryption. You can find more information on this on my website.
