## HTTPS HANDSHAKE ## 

Hello everyone, in this article, I will try to introduce one of the questions that might be asked in interviews: the HTTPS handshake, also known as the SSL/TLS handshake. Even if it's not an interview question, I can say that it's one of the essential topics to know if you work in or are interested in the field of cybersecurity. I should remind you that the handshake process I'm describing is for SSL/TLS up to version 1.2. In the latest version, SSL/TLS 1.3, the handshake structure and the asymmetric encryption used are different, which I will cover in another article. Additionally, to better understand the SSL/TLS handshake process, you need to know the working principles of both asymmetric and symmetric encryption. You can find more information on this on my website.

Looking at the handshake structure below, if we need to summarize this handshake process in bullet points:

**Certificate Check:** This is the step where we declare the authenticity of the other party and come to a mutual agreement.

**Client Hello:** The client sends the SSL/TLS versions and a list of ciphers it can support to the server.

**Server Hello:** The server sends the SSL/TLS versions and a list of ciphers it can support to the client.

**Certification:** The server provides its certificate information to the client. One of the most important pieces of information in this certificate is the server's Public Key.

**Server Hello Done:** With the "Hello Done" message that the server sends to the other party, the first step of the communication is completed.

I want to provide a few pieces of information about the handshake process related to the certificate. We ask a group called Certificate Authorities about the certificate provided by the server. The reason for this is to confirm the authenticity of the other party. To better understand this, you need to know about Certificate Authorities or the topic of the Modern Web. But for now, this brief information should be enough for you.



**Key Change:** This is the step where the secret key generated by the client is sent to the other party and the key exchange takes place.

**Client Key Exchange:** A symmetric encryption algorithm is determined from the symmetric encryption list provided by the server, and a secret key is created using this algorithm. This created secret key is then encrypted with the Public Key that the server gave us and is sent to the server.

**Change Cipher Spec(Client):** The client declares to the server that it is ready for data sharing using the symmetric encryption algorithm that was determined.

**Change Cipher Spec(Server):** The server declares to the client that it is ready for data sharing using the symmetric encryption algorithm that was determined.



**Data Transmission:** Data transfer takes place using the symmetric encryption that they have agreed upon.

Of course, let's not overlook that the TCP three-way handshake occurs in the background before the Client Hello flag. I mentioned that in another one of my articles. I've tried to present the SSL/TLS handshake structure to you in its simplest form.
