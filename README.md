## Asymmetric encryption(Public Key Encryption)
In this article, I will explain asymmetric encryption, which is the backbone of cryptography. Before delving into asymmetric encryption, we need to understand how symmetric encryption works because asymmetric encryption and symmetric encryption are related and work together. You can find my article on this topic on my website. Asymmetric encryption, which was founded in 1970, was developed to address the security vulnerability brought by symmetric encryption. To briefly summarize the working principle of symmetric encryption, it involves the use of one key for both encryption and decryption. This is where the vulnerability of symmetric encryption arises. The recipient must also have the Secret Key that will be used for encryption. In an insecure world like the internet, direct access to this key is a vulnerability for us. And because of this, asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, entered our lives. In asymmetric encryption, we have two types of keys: the Public Key and the Private Key.

### Public Key
You can freely share this key everywhere, whether it is secure or not. When a person wants to send data to you, they use this key.
